# Linear Programming

## Introduction

Linear programming is a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. It is a special case of mathematical programming (mathematical optimization).

## Key Concepts

1. **Objective Function:**
   - The function that needs to be optimized (maximized or minimized).
   - Example: Maximize profit.

2. **Decision Variables:**
   - Variables that represent the choices available in the problem
   - Example: The number of each type of toy to produce.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The restrictions or limitations on the decision variables.
   - Example: Resource limitations.

4. **Feasibility:**
   - The solution must satisfy all constraints.
