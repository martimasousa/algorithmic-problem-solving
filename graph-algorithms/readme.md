# Graph Algorithms

## Introduction

Graph algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and are used to solve problems related to graph theory. These algorithms work on the structure of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.

## Key Concepts

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, or edge lists.
   - Example: Adjacency list representation of a graph.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Graph traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes in a graph.
   - Example: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Used Techniques

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Solved Problems Summary
